Simple demo that subscribes to a redis channel and puts the output to a
websocket

IMPORTANT: 
=========

You will need to make changes to the Camel route in order to get this to work. 

In src/main/java/demo/websocket/RedisSubscriberRoute.java

In this java line from("spring-redis://localhost:6379?command=SUBSCRIBE&channels=mychannel&serializer=#redisserializer")
       1.  change localhost to the IP of the Redis server 
       2.  change mychannel to name of the redischannel 
         


To complile 
===================

1. $mvn clean install
2. If everything goes fine you should see 
   target/jettycamelwebsocketredis.war file 


To start the server 
===================
1. To start the server use run.sh script (it just invokes the war file with the
   jettyrun jar included with the project) 

If the server starts properly then you should something like the following:

To see the output on the webpage 
================================

Try 
http://<ip of the jettyserver>:8080/index.html 

You should see a stream of tweets that are being pushed into the Redis channel
on the browser
